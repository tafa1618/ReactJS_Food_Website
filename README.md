# Converting Html css JS project to React app

This project is a about converting an existing web project to react App I Grabed the ling from Yotube  [Mr Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJUssi2c6Ls&ab_channel=Mr.WebDesigner).

In my research I founded there are two ways to include React in an existing Project, the ibvious is that used in the React Documentation, I tried it but doesn't fit my need
So I used the second one, create a react App, copy and paste the entire html code to App.js 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
